# TributePage
Tribute Page is a HTML and CSS based web page to practice basics of HTML and CSS like heading, paragraph, image, text-styling, borders, margins. 

In this page I used basic HTML tags which includes:

1. &lt;h1&gt; - This is a heading tag and is used for main headings. The content in &lt;h1&gt; is largest, but developer can also adjust the size of text depending upon the design       requirement.
2. &lt;h3&gt; - This is used for sub-heading. Its size is smaller than &lt;h1&gt;
3. &lt;p&gt; - To create a paragraph, surrong the words that  make up a paragraph with an opening &lt;p&gt; tag and closig &lt;p&gt; tag. By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new  line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.
4. &lt;b&gt; - This tag helps make the text enclosed between it looks bold.
5. &lt;hr /&gt; - This tag is used to create horizontal rule between sections.
6. &lt;img&gt; - This tag is used for images

For CSS, I have used internal CSS in this project for styling body, h1, h3, hr. p, img.
